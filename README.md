# stopLight

# How It's Made:
Made a stop light where as soon as the User lands on this page The stop light will transition from green to yellow to red and then it will repeat itself at a one second interval.  WHile the stop light is on Red, the crosswalk signal will also light up.

# Tech used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# Lessons Learned:
I learned how to use animations in my code to get the transitions from the colors at a specific interval
